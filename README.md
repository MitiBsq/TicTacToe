# TicTacToe
Project-->5

This is my fifth project where im testing my beginner javascript knowledge with a little bit of css and of course html5

The project theme is the "old-classic" game "TicTacTOe" where you have to put either 'X' or '0' in one of the 9 squares and after a few plyaer vs computer/player moves  yu find out if you won or not
